I currently fulfill a postdoctoral position at the [Dynamics and Control Systems Laboratory](http://dcsl.gatech.edu/) at Georgia Tech, where I've specialized in creating novel navigation algorithms for robotic systems.
I hold my Ph.D. from the School of Aerospace Engineering at Georgia Tech, under the advisement of [Professor Panagiotis Tsiotras](http://dcsl.gatech.edu/tsiotras.html).

My Ph.D. research work focused on adapting Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) for robotic operations in space, such as spacecraft rendezvous and proximity operations, as well as celestial small body probing and surveying missions.
